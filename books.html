            <h1>Top Ten Books According To Me</h1>
            <h4>(SPOILERS) DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS</h4>
            <article class="book-entry">


                <h4>The Hunger Games</h4>
                <h5>Suzanne Collins</h5>
                <img src="images/hungergames.jpg" alt="Hunger Games" />
                <p>The Hunger Games! One of my favorites as you can see, it is in my top 10. In my opinion, the plot is
                    REALLY good. It's about 12 districts, in which each of them chooses two people to represent their
                    district in the annual Hunger Games. The Hunger Games challenges these representatives in a game of
                    survival, with challenges like fire, tsunamis, and unheard of monsters, including oppenents(other
                    districts)themselves. What's more exciting than that? Suzanne Collins gives us great
                    character development, that lets us connect to our characters and understand how they feel in
                    certain situations. Trust me, if your friends tell you to read this, READ IT!! </p>

                <h4>Warcross</h4>
                <h5>Marie Lu</h5>
                <img src="images/warcross.jpg" alt="Warcross" />
                <p>OMG MARIE LU!!! I got to say, she is my favorite author of all time. Warcross
                    is
                    one of my favorites,
                    as it has a great story plot, and a nice touch of romance. If you're a person who likes intense
                    romance, hackers, or anything to do with computers, this book is definitely for you! Emika Chen is
                    just an average citizen in this world. HOwever, she has a great deal of money on her that she must
                    pay for her loan on the house she is living in. The only way of relaxation is through a game called
                    Warcross. Warcross is a fighting game, made by Hideo Tanaka. When Emika is called to be the computer
                    person for him when someone hacks into the system, Emika must find out the hacker. If you listened
                    to my big deal on spoilers before, you would already know this because I expected you to read this
                    book already. Scroll down for more Marie Lu! </p>
