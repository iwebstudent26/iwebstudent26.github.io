                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <div class="date">06/14/2019</div>
                <p>This week, I learned how to make a live website on GitHub. The first thing that I did was log in to
                    Git Hub, and make a repositroy that I named iwebstudent26.github.io, which is the URL for the
                    website.(https://iwebstudent.github.io) Next, I git cloned my repo onto my computer's desktop. then
                    I used an
                    app called VS Code to edit my file. I then created my index.html file, the home page, as well as a
                    CSS style called style.css. Everyday at the end of the day, I commited my changes and pushed them up
                    to the server. I then had a working website, which you are currently looking at now.</p>
