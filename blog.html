                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <div class="date">07/12/2019</div>
                <p>This week was kind of about your own type of customization. We got to add to our websites and our
                    teacher showed us different types of design patterns and how other people did them. I was able to
                    use Photoshop to make a picture made of two different pictures, so that it looked really nice.</p>

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">07/5/2019</div>
                <p>This week was about completing our coded website, as well as some things in design. I myself added a
                    few more books on my Books page, as well as making a prototype in XD by adding subpages and
                    connecting them with weird string thingymabobs.It was really cool because it acted as a real website
                    without code! </p>

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <div class="date">06/28/2019</div>
                <p>This week was all about design! We used professional apps like Adobe Phooshop, Illustrator, and XD.
                    Photoshop allowed us to get photos and change them up a little, such as brightening them up, or
                    blurring them, as well as cleaning up the marks that you don't want. Illustrator allowed us to take
                    this picture and change the shapes of it. For these two apps this week, all we did was experiment
                    with them. However, XD allowed us to design our website, as well as prototype them, which is what
                    we'll be doing next weak. This allowed us to see what we could make our website look like, as well
                    as prototype it to be like our real website. </p>

                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <div class="date">06/21/2019</div>
                <p>I started to add some more HTML and CSS to my website, for example the footer and header. I then
                    created two subpages, About and Blog. About contains different links that I used to make this
                    website, as well as other websites that contained essential information in web design. Blog contains
                    the information you are reading now, a summary of what I've been doing each week. By this time, I
                    had three pages for my website: Home, About, and Blog. I'm not giving you links becuase I think that
                    you can find out how to get there. For example, the menu above. *smiles</p>

                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <div class="date">06/14/2019</div>
                <p>This week, I learned how to make a live website on Git Hub. The first thing that I did was
                    log in to Git Hub, and make a repository that I named iwebstudent26.github.io, which is kind of like
                    the URL of my website (https://iwebstudent26.github.io). Next, I git cloned my repo onto my
                    computer's
                    desktop. Then I used an app called VS Code to edit my file. I then created my index.html file, the
                    home page, as well as adding CSS to it, the file called style.css. Everyday at the end of the day, I
                    commited my
                    changes and pushed them up to the server. I then had a working website, which you are currently
                    looking at now. (huhu, waggles eyebrows.... MY GRAMMER IS GREAT!)</p>
